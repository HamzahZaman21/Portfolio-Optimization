# Portfolio-Optimization

The portfolio optimization file contains code to find the optimized allocation of capital for a given a target return, given multiple products and their given expected return and co-variance matrix. The code outputs allocation of capital and variation of return for each target return given.

The code uses Markowitz portfolio model to find optimized allocation.
